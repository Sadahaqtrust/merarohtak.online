# Selero

**Selero — Open-source Monolithic E-commerce Platform**

Selero is a youth-friendly, open-source monolithic e-commerce platform to start an online marketplace and community services. This repo contains the web application (frontend + monolithic backend in one codebase) for quick MVP launches.

## Goal
Bootstrap an extensible monolith for marketplace, product management, orders, payments integration, and community features (events, volunteering, training).

## Tech (recommended starter)
- Frontend: React (Vite) or Next.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or an integrated Next.js API)
- DB: PostgreSQL / SQLite for local dev
- Auth: Supabase Auth / Firebase / custom JWT
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render/Heroku (backend) or single fullstack platform

## Quick start (Vite + Express monolith example)
1. Clone repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/selero.git
cd selero
